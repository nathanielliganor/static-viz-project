# Visualizations for "Asylum in America, by the Numbers"

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the narrative of "Asylum in America, by the Numbers" through the design and creation of three compelling visualizations. Each visualization aims to encapsulate key data points and trends highlighted in the article, providing readers with an immediate and impactful understanding of the facts presented. The visualizations cover the topics of illegal crossing apprehensions in 2022, historical data on total asylum applications split by status, and immigration patterns concerning forced removals and refugee arrivals.

## Objectives

- To design and create three visualizations that accompany and enrich the story told by "Asylum in America, by the Numbers."
- To include a written report describing the design process behind each visualization, ensuring the visuals are both informative and engaging.
- To create a visualization highlighting the record number of illegal crossing apprehensions since 1960.
- To develop a visualization that details historical data on total asylum applications, split by status.
- To produce a visualization illustrating immigration patterns, focusing on forced removals and refugee arrivals.

### 1. Illegal Crossing Apprehensions in 2022

**Objective**: To depict the significant rise in illegal crossing apprehensions in 2022, marking the highest number since 1960.

**Design Process**: The visualization was created using a time series graph, plotting the number of apprehensions from 1960 to 2022. A distinct upward trend is highlighted in 2022, with annotations to emphasize the record-breaking figure. The choice of a time series allows for a clear historical context and immediate visualization of the increase over time.

### 2. Historical Data on Total Asylum Applications Split by Status

**Objective**: Depict the annual number of asylum applications by status (Filed, Granted, Pending) from 2008 to 2022, along with a cumulative total.

**Design Process**: Transitioning to a multi-line graph, this visualization contrasts the trajectories of applications filed, granted, and pending. An additional line aggregates these categories to show the total number of applications. This format was selected to facilitate comparison across statuses over time, highlighting trends and shifts in asylum application outcomes.

### 3. Forced Removals vs. Refugee Arrivals

**Objective**: Compare the annual figures for forced removals and refugee arrivals from 2009 to 2022.

**Design Process**: A stacked bar graph was chosen for its ability to showcase two distinct but related datasets within the same visual space. Each bar represents a year, divided into segments that correspond to the numbers of forced removals and refugees, allowing for an at-a-glance comparison of these two critical immigration metrics over time. This visualization effectively demonstrates the balance or disparity between the US's enforcement and humanitarian responses to immigration.

## Conclusion

Through these visualizations, the project not only complements but deepens the insights offered in "Asylum in America, by the Numbers." By presenting data in an accessible and visually engaging manner, we aim to foster a more nuanced understanding of the current asylum and immigration landscape in the US, making complex data digestible for a broader audience.
